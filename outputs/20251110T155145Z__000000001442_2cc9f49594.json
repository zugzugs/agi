Install it with `pip install click`.\",\n    \"Integrating Click and FastAPI: Create a separate module for the CLI commands and import it into your main FastAPI application. In the CLI module, define and register commands using Click's decorators.\",\n    \"Registering CLI Commands: Use FastAPI's router system to register these commands as endpoints that can be accessed via HTTP.\",\n    \"Running the Application: Start the FastAPI application with `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` and interact with your CLI via the command line by sending requests to the appropriate HTTP endpoints.\",\n    \"Code Example: Here's a simple example of a Hello World CLI using FastAPI, Click, and Uvicorn.\"\n  ],\n\n  \"code_examples\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"```\\n\\\nimport fastapi\\nfrom fastapi.responses import JSONResponse\\nfrom fastapi.routers import APIRouter\\nfrom fastapi.openapi.utils import get_openapi\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nfrom typing import List\\nimport click\\n\\napp = fastapi.FastAPI()\\nrouter = APIRouter()\\n\\nclass Item(BaseModel):\\tname: str\\tdescription: str\\n\\nitems: List[Item] = []\\n\\n@app.get('/items', response_model=List[Item])\\ndef get_items():\\treturn items\\n\\n@router.post('/add_item')\\ndef add_item(item: Item):\\titems.append(item)\\n\\n@router.cli_route()\\ndef cli():\\tclick.echo('Welcome to the FastAPI CLI')\\n\\napp.include_router(router)\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    uvicorn.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)\\n```\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"version_notes\": [\n    \"Python version: 3.12+\"\n  ],\n\n  \"caveats\": [\n    \"While FastAPI supports CLI tools, it's worth noting that it was primarily designed for web APIs.
