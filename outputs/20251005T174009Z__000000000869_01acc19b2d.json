It aims to help developers write more efficient and reliable test cases.\",\n  \"key_points\": [\n    \"Understand the purpose of doctest: it allows embedding interactive Python sessions within docstrings to be automatically tested as part of a module's documentation.\",\n    \"Avoid hardcoding output in your tests, as this makes your tests brittle and sensitive to changes. Use the expected argument instead to specify expected outputs.\",\n    \"Ensure that you use triple quotes (\"\"\" or '''') for your test cases within docstrings. Single quotes will cause doctest to fail because they are used in Python for string literals.\",\n    \"Remember to document not only the functionality of your functions, but also edge cases and potential issues. This helps to ensure that your tests cover a wide range of scenarios.\",\n    \"Be aware that doctest does not support exceptions by default. If you want to test exception handling, use the `raise` statement within your tests and check for the appropriate exception being raised in the output.\",\n    \"If you're using third-party libraries, make sure they also have good doctests.

Consider using dedicated testing frameworks like unittest or pytest for larger projects.\",\n    \"Remember that doctests are not a replacement for thorough unit tests, but rather a useful tool for verifying the functionality and documentation of smaller functions.\"\n  ]\n}",
