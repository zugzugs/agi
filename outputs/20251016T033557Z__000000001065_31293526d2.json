The most specific selector should be listed last for accurate matching.\",\n    \"Be aware that some attributes are case-sensitive, while others are not. Use lowercase attribute names consistently for simplicity.\",\n    \"Avoid using ID selectors whenever possible, as they can create unintended consequences when multiple elements share the same ID.\",\n    \"Use class selectors if you need to target specific elements with a common class name.\",\n    \"Remember that Python's selectors module does not support complex CSS selectors like :hover, :active, etc. Use JavaScript if you need these advanced selectors.\"\n  ],\n\n  \"code_examples\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"from selectorlib import Selector\\n\\nselector = Selector(\\n    html=\\'<html>\\n        <body>\\n            <div class=\\\"example\\\">Hello World</div>\\n            <div id=\\\"example2\\\">Goodbye World</div>\\n        </body>\\n    \\',\\n    selector_class='lxml'\\n)\\n\\ndivs = selector.css('div')\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"from urllib.request import urlopen\\nhtml = urlopen(\\'https://example.com/\\').read().decode()\\nselector = Selector(text=html, selector_class='lxml')\\ndivs = selector.css('div')\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"version_notes\": [\n    \"Python 3.12+ is required for using the selectors module with its latest improvements.\",\n    \"It's recommended to use third-party libraries like selectorlib for easier handling of CSS selectors.\"\n  ],\n\n  \"caveats\": [\n    \"Using selectors can sometimes be slow, especially when dealing with large amounts of HTML content.
