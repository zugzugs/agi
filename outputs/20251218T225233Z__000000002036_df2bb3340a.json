FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework that simplifies building APIs and provides excellent features for data pipelines.\",\n\n  \"key_points\": [\n    \"FastAPI offers an easy-to-use syntax for defining routes, handling HTTP requests and responses, and managing dependencies.\",\n    \"It supports asynchronous operations out of the box, which is essential for efficient data pipeline processing.\",\n    \"FastAPI provides automatic documentation generation based on your code structure, making it easier to understand and maintain your API.\",\n    \"The framework integrates with popular libraries like Uvicorn for production-ready ASGI servers, and Starlette for a flexible request/response handling library.\",\n    \"Data pipelines can be easily tested using FastAPI's built-in testing functionality and third-party tools like pytest.\"\n  ],\n\n  \"code_examples\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"from fastapi import FastAPI\\napp = FastAPI()\\n\\n@app.get('/pipeline')\\ndef pipeline():\\n   # Your data pipeline code here\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"if __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    uvicorn.run(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=8000)\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"version_notes\": [\n    \"FastAPI version 0.69.0 and above supports Python 3.12.\",\n    \"Ensure your virtual environment has FastAPI, Uvicorn, pytest, and any other required packages installed.\"\n  ],\n\n  \"caveats\": [\n    \"Although FastAPI simplifies building APIs, it may have a learning curve if you're new to web frameworks.\",\n    \"FastAPI is not a replacement for traditional data pipeline libraries like Apache Airflow or Prefect, but can be used alongside them to expose data pipeline functionality as REST APIs.\"\n  ]\n}",
