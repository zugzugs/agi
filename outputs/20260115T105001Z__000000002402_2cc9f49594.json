By utilizing FastAPI's flexible and user-friendly architecture, you can create powerful and easy-to-use command line tools.\",\n  \"key_points\": [\n    \"FastAPI provides a consistent and intuitive interface for handling both web and CLI applications.\",\n    \"You don't need to write separate codebases for web APIs and CLIs— FastAPI makes it possible to use the same codebase for both.\",\n    \"FastAPI includes built-in support for command line arguments, making it easy to accept user input and perform operations based on that input.\",\n    \"You can take advantage of FastAPI's powerful features such as type hinting, automatic documentation generation, and more when building your CLI tools.\",\n  ],\n  \"code_examples\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"Python\",\n      \"code\": \"from fastapi import FastAPI\\napp = FastAPI()\\n@app.get('/')\\ndef main():\\n    print('Welcome to the CLI tool!')\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"language\": \"Python\",\n      \"code\": \"from fastapi import FastAPI, Args\\napp = FastAPI()\\n@app.get('/')\\ndef main(args: Args):\\n    print(f'Argument: {args.query_params[\"arg_name\"]}')\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"version_notes\": [\n    \"Python 3.12+ is required to run this example.\",\n    \"FastAPI version 0.74.0 or higher is recommended.\"\n  ],\n  \"caveats\": [\n    \"While FastAPI provides built-in support for command line arguments, more complex CLI tools may require additional libraries such as argparse.\",\n    \"Keep in mind that FastAPI is primarily designed for web APIs and might not provide all the features you'd expect from a dedicated CLI framework.\"\n  ]\n}",
