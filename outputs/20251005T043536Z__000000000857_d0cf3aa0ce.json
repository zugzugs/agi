Initialize them using init method or field-specific initializers.\",\n    \"Dataclass Field Types: Fields can be either mutable or immutable and can have default values or can be optional.\",\n    \"Magic Methods: Dataclasses automatically generate several magic methods, such as __init__, __repr__, __eq__, __lt__ and more. However, you can override them if needed.\",\n    \"Final Fields: Use final keyword to make a field read-only and enforce that it won't be replaced during initialization.\",\n    \"Using Dataclasses with __post_init__: If your class has complex initialization logic that can't be handled by the init method, use the special method __post_init__.\",\n    \"Dataclass Context Manager: Creating context managers is now easier with dataclasses. Simply implement a method named __enter__ and/or __exit__, and the dataclass will automatically support using it as a context manager.\",\n  ],\n\n  \"code_examples\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"from dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Point:\\n    x: int\\n    y: float = 0.0\\n    z: float = field(default=1.0, init=False)\\n\\ndef __post_init__(self):\\n    self.z += 2\\n\\npoint = Point(x=3, y=4.5)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"code\": \"from dataclasses import dataclass, field\\nfrom typing import Iterator\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass MyContextManager:\\n    value: int\\n    __slots__ = ('value',)\\n\\n    def __enter__(self):\\n        self.value += 10\\n        return self\\n\\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):\\n        self.value -= 10\\n\\nwith MyContextManager() as cm:\\n    print(cm.value)\"\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"version_notes\": [\n    \"Python 3.7: Introduction of dataclasses\",\n    \"Python 3.8: Support for field-specific initializers and final fields\",\n    \"Python 3.12+: Improved support for context managers\"\n  ],\n\n  \"caveats\": [\n    \"Dataclasses don't automatically inherit from any base class, so if you need to use methods from a parent class, make sure to explicitly inherit.\",\n    \"Not all types are supported as field types.
